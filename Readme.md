# 2018 OOI Early Career Data Workshops

In the spring and summer of 2018, the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) hosted a series of 4 workshops for early-career scientists interested in learning more about the OOI and how to use data from the program in their work. The workshops focused on the development of programming, data analysis, and evaluation skills, and provided participants with an overview of the marine infrastructure and software tools maintained by the OOI.

More information about this workshop is available on the [OOI website](http://oceanobservatories.org/data-workshops/).

This repository contains the *tutorials* and *example Python scripts* presented during each of the workshops, as well as many of the [handouts](handouts) provided.  In addition, participants at each workshop were asked to analyze data from a selection of OOI instruments and create a *Data Quality Report* with their findings.

The examples and reports can be found in the sub directory of this repository for each of the corresponding workshops.
