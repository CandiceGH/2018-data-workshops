# OOI Hydrophone Example

[Waveform_Plotting_and_Audio.ipynb](Waveform_Plotting_and_Audio.ipynb) demonstrates how to load in a miniseed file directly off the OOI Raw Data Archive, create a waveform and export an mp3 file.

For additional examples on processing hydrophone data and creating spectrograms, please see the [hydrophone examples](https://github.com/oceanhackweek/CAHW2018_Materials/tree/master/Projects/Hydrophone) from the 2018 Cabled Array Hack Week.
