# OOI Early Career Data Workshop I - Physics

On May 21-25, 2018, 10 early career researchers participated in an OOI physics data workshop at Rutgers University. Participants received several lectures on the OOI structure and science questions, tutorials on Python and how to access OOI data, and were given time to develop and present their own data validation report.  More information about this workshop is available on the [OOI website](http://oceanobservatories.org/data-workshops/).

### Data Processing Example Scripts
During the workshop, a number of example scripts were provided to demonstrate how to access and use data from the OOI.  They can be found in the [examples](examples) folder.

### Data Validation Reports
As part of the workshop, each participant created a *Data Validation Report* analyzing the quality of one or more OOI instruments.
